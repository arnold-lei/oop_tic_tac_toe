# 2 Players draw a game board of 9 squares. 
# Players then choose one of the empty squares and place a marker 
# The player with 3 in a row wins

#Create a grid with empty spaces that can be filled
#Assign user to X and computer to O
#Get Xs from the user and have them place them at some EMPTY point in the grid
#Have the Os randomly generate from the computer and goes on and empty point in the grid
#Wash, rinse, repeat (loop) UNTIL...
#If 3 xs or 3 os are in a row, then one of the players wins or all squares are taken (tie)
#If there's a winner, show the winner / else state it's a tie

#loop until a winner or all squares are taken
  #player1 picks an empty square
  #check for a winner â€“ this is variable
  #player2 picks an empty square
  #check for a winner

#if there's a winner
  #show the winner
#or else
  #it's a tie

#puts "Welcome to tic tac toe, would you like to be X or O? Pick one (X/O)"
